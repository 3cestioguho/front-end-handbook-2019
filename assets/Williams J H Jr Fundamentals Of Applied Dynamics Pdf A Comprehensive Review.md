- Chapter 2: Design, Modeling, and Formulation of Equations of Motion. This chapter introduces the concepts and methods of modeling dynamical systems and deriving their equations of motion.
- Chapter 3: Kinematics. This chapter covers the geometry and algebra of motion, including three-dimensional kinematics, relative motion, and rigid body motion.
- Chapter 4: Momentum Formulation for Systems of Particles. This chapter applies the principle of linear and angular momentum to systems of particles, including collisions, impulse-momentum relations, and conservation laws.
- Chapter 5: Variational Formulation for Systems of Particles. This chapter applies the principle of least action and the calculus of variations to systems of particles, including Lagrange's equations, Hamilton's principle, and Noether's theorem.
- Chapter 6: Dynamics of Systems Containing Rigid Bodies. This chapter extends the momentum and variational formulations to systems containing rigid bodies, including Euler's equations, gyroscopic motion, and holonomic and nonholonomic constraints.
- Chapter 7: Dynamics of Electrical and Electromechanical Systems. This chapter introduces the dynamics of lumped-parameter electrical and electromagnetic devices, including Kirchhoff's laws, Maxwell's equations, electromechanical coupling, and energy methods.
- Chapter 8: Vibration of Linear Lumped-Parameter Systems. This chapter covers the theory and applications of vibration analysis for linear lumped-parameter systems, including free and forced vibrations, resonance, damping, modal analysis, and frequency response.

The appendices provide some theoretical and mathematical support for the main text, such as elementary results of the calculus of variations, some formulations of the principles of Hamilton, Lagrange's form of d'Alembert's principle, and a brief review of electromagnetic theory[^2^].
