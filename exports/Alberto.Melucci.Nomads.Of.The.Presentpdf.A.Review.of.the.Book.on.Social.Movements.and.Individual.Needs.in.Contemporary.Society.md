Alberto Melucci was an Italian sociologist who studied social movements and collective action in the context of modernity and post-industrial society. His book, *Nomads of the Present: Social Movements and Individual Needs in Contemporary Society*, published in 1989, is a collection of essays that explore the nature, dynamics, and challenges of new social movements that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, such as feminism, environmentalism, peace activism, and alternative culture.

In this book, Melucci argues that these movements are not driven by material interests or ideological goals, but by the search for identity, autonomy, and meaning in a complex and uncertain world. He calls them "nomads of the present" because they are constantly moving and changing, adapting to new situations and opportunities, and challenging the established order and dominant values. He also suggests that these movements represent a new form of social action that is based on symbolic communication, network organization, and cultural innovation.
  
Melucci's book is a valuable contribution to the sociology of social movements and to the understanding of contemporary society. It offers a theoretical framework that integrates structural, cultural, and psychological factors, as well as a comparative analysis of different types of movements and their historical contexts. It also provides insights into the dilemmas and potentials of collective action in a globalized and diversified world.

In this article, we will review some of the main themes and arguments of Melucci's book, and discuss their relevance and implications for today's social movements and society. We will focus on three aspects: the definition and characteristics of new social movements, the role of culture and identity in collective action, and the challenges and opportunities of network organization and communication.
  
## The Definition and Characteristics of New Social Movements
  
Melucci defines social movements as "forms of collective action that emerge when a system of action is in conflict with its environment" (p. 3). He distinguishes between two types of social movements: old and new. Old social movements are those that emerged in the industrial era and were based on class conflict, material interests, and political representation. They aimed to change the distribution of power and resources in society, and to gain access to the institutions of the state. Examples of old social movements are labor unions, socialist parties, and nationalist movements.
  
New social movements are those that emerged in the post-industrial era and are based on cultural conflict, individual needs, and symbolic expression. They aim to change the quality of life and the values of society, and to create alternative spaces and forms of participation. Examples of new social movements are feminist movements, environmental movements, peace movements, and alternative culture movements.
  
Melucci identifies four main characteristics of new social movements:
  
- They are latent rather than manifest. This means that they are not always visible or organized, but they exist as potentialities or tendencies in society. They emerge when certain conditions or events trigger them, such as crises, scandals, or innovations.
- They are diffuse rather than centralized. This means that they do not have a clear leadership or structure, but they are composed of multiple groups and networks that operate autonomously and flexibly. They also have a pluralistic and diverse membership that does not share a common identity or ideology.
- They are symbolic rather than instrumental. This means that they do not have a specific or realistic goal or strategy, but they use symbols, images, and emotions to communicate their messages and values. They also have a performative and expressive dimension that involves creativity, art, and lifestyle.
- They are subversive rather than reformist. This means that they do not seek to integrate into or influence the existing system, but they challenge its legitimacy and assumptions. They also create alternative spaces and practices that contrast with or oppose the dominant ones.
