## Step 1: Download and Install Cheat Engine
 
The first step is to download and install cheat engine from its official website[^1^]. Cheat engine is a tool that allows you to scan and modify the memory of any process running on your computer. You can use it to hack games, create trainers, or just experiment with different values. Make sure you have the latest version of cheat engine, which is 7.5 as of April 2023.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install Metrix's DLL
 
The next step is to download and install Metrix's DLL from this link[^3^]. Metrix's DLL is a modified version of the game's original DLL that disables the anti-cheat and allows cheat engine to access the game's memory. To install it, you need to extract the files from the zip archive using the password fearlessrevolution.com and double click the install.bat file. This will copy the DLL to the game's folder and rename the original DLL to something else.
 
## Step 3: Launch Demonophobia and Cheat Engine
 
Now you can launch Demonophobia and cheat engine. Make sure you run both programs as administrator. In cheat engine, click on the computer icon and select Demonophobia.exe from the process list. Then click on Open. You should see a message saying "DLL injected" in the bottom left corner of cheat engine. This means that Metrix's DLL has successfully bypassed the anti-cheat and you can now scan and modify the game's memory.
 
## Step 4: Find and Change Values
 
The final step is to find and change the values you want in the game. For example, if you want to change your health, you can do the following:
 
- In cheat engine, click on Add Address Manually.
- Type "Demonophobia.exe+1F8C" in the Address field.
- Type "Health" in the Description field.
- Select "4 Bytes" in the Value Type field.
- Click on OK.
- You should see a new entry in the address list with your current health value.
- Double click on the value and change it to whatever you want.
- Go back to the game and see your health change accordingly.

You can use this method to find and change other values in the game, such as inventory items, speed, or position. You can also use cheat engine's features such as scan type, value type, or pointer scan to find values that are not static. However, be careful not to change values that may cause errors or crashes in the game.
